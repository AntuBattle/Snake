# Snake
Snake made with linked lists and the library ncurses.h

Unfortunately, the notes in the code are in italian since I made this project during my first year of university, to sustain an exam. Everything is created using linked lists. There are structs for the snake, for the single bodypart of the snake, for the food, and one struct that connects them all, the "game" struct. There also are structs that keep track of the score of the single players and structs that keep track of the registered players as well. This is of course improvable, but it was a good exercise on linked list nevertheless. And it was great fun to write and play as well!
